'Place the grease-filled muffin tins into the oven, and turn the temperature up to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Let the muffin tins preheat for 10 minutes, then fill 3/4 full with the refrigerated batter, and return to the oven. Bake 20 to 25 minutes until the puddings have risen tall and are golden brown.',
'While the Yorkshire puddings are baking, place the roasting pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Stir in the wine, and bring to a simmer while scraping to dissolve the pan drippings; pour in the beef stock and return to a simmer. Cook 10 minutes, then strain and serve with the roast and puddings.',

    'To prepare the langoustines, pull off the head and pincers. Lay the tail flat on a chopping board and use a sharp pair of scissors to cut a line straight down the back of the shell. Carefully peel the langoustine, score down the back, then remove the grit sac.',

'Get the oil heating in a large saucepan or wok – you will need enough to come 2-3in up the side of the pan. For the tartare sauce, mix all ingredients in a bowl and season.',

'Place the flours in a bowl with a good pinch of salt and pepper. Add the beer and sparkling water, and whisk to a smooth batter.',

'To test if the oil is hot enough, put a drop of batter into the pan – it should crisp and brown within 30 secs. Dip each langoustine or prawn tail into the batter, then carefully drop it into the oil. Drizzle a little extra batter over each one while they are cooking – this will give you a really crispy coating. Cook them in batches, making sure you dont overcrowd the pan. When golden and floating to the surface, scoop out and drain well on kitchen paper. Sprinkle the scampi with salt and serve with the tartare sauce, lemon wedges and chips.',

'Tuck the prawn tails into the rice and simmer for 5 mins, turning them over until cooked through. Stir through the mussels and broad beans or peas. Taste the rice – if it is still a little raw but the pan is dry, add a splash more stock and continue to cook; if its too soupy, then increase the heat to cook off the last of the stock.',

'Once the rice is just cooked, turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel for a few minutes. Scatter over the parsley leaves and lemon zest, then season with smoked salt if you like. Stir everything once, then serve straight from the pan, with lemon wedges on the side.',

  description: 'Cheap seafood and potato salad.',
  ingredients: [
      '2 cooked lobsters, about 500g each',
'250g fine green bean, cooked',
'2 shallots, finely chopped',
'6 tbsp olive oil',
'1 lemon, halved',
'12 new potatoes, cooked',
'100g mixed baby salad leaf',
'1 tsp white balsamic vinegar',
'2 egg yolks',
'1 tbsp English mustard',
'300ml olive oil',
'few drops truffle oil',
'juice ½ lemon',
  ],
  instructions: [
    'To make the mayonnaise, whisk the egg yolks with the mustard and some salt and pepper together in a large bowl. Trickle in a few drops of oil, whisking vigorously.',

'Continue to whisk in the oil, little by little at first, then slowly increasing the amount to a steady stream. Make sure each addition is well incorporated before you add any more. Finally, add a few drops of the truffle oil, if using, then finish with the lemon juice. Keep in the fridge until needed.',

'Prepare the lobster and remove the meat from the claws and tail. Trim the frayed bit of meat from the tails and flake the claw meat into large chunks, discarding the membrane. Set aside. Cut the tails into 6 slices each and set aside.',

'Trim the ends off the beans and cut the beans in half. Tip into a bowl with the shallots and 3 tbsp of the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the lobster claw meat and squeeze over a lemon half, then set aside.',

'Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a non-stick frying pan. Fry the potato slices over a medium heat for 5 mins on each side until crisp and golden. Use a fish slice to transfer them to a plate lined with kitchen paper.',

'Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in the same pan and lower the heat, add the slices of tail meat to the pan, then heat through in the oil for a few moments on each side. Turn off the heat, season lightly with salt and pepper and squeeze over the lemon. Moments before you are ready to plate up, toss the salad leaves with the balsamic vinegar and remaining olive oil. You are now ready to plate up.',


'Spoon a quarter of the green bean salad into the centre of the plate. Shape using a 10cm ring or cutter, if you have one, then press down lightly and remove the ring. Place 1 tsp of mayonnaise on the four opposite sides of the outside of the plate and sit a piece of lobster on top of each spoonful of mayonnaise.',

'Put a fried potato slice in between each pile of lobster so you have alternate pieces of lobster, then potato. Toss the leaves in the dressing and carefully tower a small handful on top of the green beans and serve straight away.',
